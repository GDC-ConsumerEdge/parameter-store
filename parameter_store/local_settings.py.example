# This is an example local_settings.py file.
#
# To use it, copy it to a new file named `local_settings.py` in the same
# directory as your main settings.py file.
#
# The `local_settings.py` file is NOT under version control, so you can use it
# to store sensitive information like database passwords or API keys, or to
# override settings for local development without affecting other developers.

# Example: Override the DEBUG setting for local development.
# DEBUG = True

# Example: Use a different database for local development.
# DATABASES = {
#     "default": {
#         "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.sqlite3",
#         "NAME": "db.sqlite3",
#     }
# }
